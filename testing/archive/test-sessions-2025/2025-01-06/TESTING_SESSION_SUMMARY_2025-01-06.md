2. Add reduced motion support
3. Implement performance monitoring
4. Create keyboard shortcut guide

### Long-term Enhancements
1. Full accessibility audit and fixes
2. Progressive Web App features
3. Offline episode support
4. Cross-browser testing expansion

## Testing Artifacts Created

### Documentation
- ‚úÖ Exploratory testing session report
- ‚úÖ Visual testing results and checklist
- ‚úÖ Performance test report
- ‚úÖ 3 detailed bug reports
- ‚úÖ Updated test cases for new episodes

### Evidence
- Component analysis with CSS values
- Performance metrics and benchmarks
- Memory usage patterns
- Responsive behavior documentation

## Regression Impact

No regressions found from the January 2025 reorganization. The new structure appears stable and well-organized.

## Sign-off Recommendation

**Recommendation:** APPROVED FOR RELEASE with fixes

The platform is ready for production deployment once the high-priority accessibility issues are addressed. The visual quality is excellent, performance is acceptable for typical usage, and the user experience is polished.

### Release Conditions
1. ‚úÖ Fix missing focus indicators (BUG-007)
2. ‚úÖ Implement basic Page Visibility API
3. ‚ö†Ô∏è Document known multi-tab limitation
4. ‚ö†Ô∏è Monitor performance in production

## Next Testing Priorities

1. **Accessibility Testing** - Full WCAG 2.1 audit
2. **Cross-browser Testing** - Firefox, Safari, Edge
3. **Mobile Responsive** - Tablet and phone layouts
4. **Load Testing** - Concurrent user simulation
5. **Security Testing** - Input validation, XSS prevention
