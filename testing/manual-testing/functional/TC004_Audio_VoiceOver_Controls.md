- Voiceover stays OFF (if global)
- OR resets (if per-episode)
- Consistent behavior
- Settings apply immediately

**Pass/Fail:** [ ]

### Step 10: Browser Refresh Audio State
**Action:**

3. Check final state

**Expected Result:**
- System handles rapid toggling
- No audio corruption
- Final state is correct
- No multiple audio streams
- UI remains responsive

**Pass/Fail:** [ ]

### Edge Case 2: Extreme Volume Changes
**Action:**
