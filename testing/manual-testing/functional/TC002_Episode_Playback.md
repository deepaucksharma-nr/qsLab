# Test Case: TC002 - Episode Playback Core Functionality
**Test Track:** Functional  
**Priority:** High  
**Last Updated:** 2025-01-06

## Test Objective
Verify episode playback functionality including scene transitions, timing, audio/visual synchronization, and player controls.

## Prerequisites
- Complete TC001 successfully
- Episode content files are properly loaded
- Audio system initialized
- Chrome DevTools open for monitoring

## Test Data
- Test Episode: "Kafka Share Groups" (S2E1)
- Expected Duration: Check episode metadata
- Number of Scenes: Verify from episode index.js

## Test Steps

### Step 1: Episode Initialization
**Action:**
1. From home page, click on "Kafka Share Groups" episode
2. Wait for episode player to load
3. Monitor console for any load errors

**Expected Result:**
- Episode player page loads
- First scene begins automatically OR shows start button
- No console errors about missing assets
- Loading indicator appears then disappears
- Player UI elements are visible

**Pass/Fail:** [ ]

### Step 2: Scene Playback Verification
**Action:**
1. Observe first scene content
2. Check if voiceover/narration starts (if applicable)
3. Verify any animations or visual effects
4. Note the scene duration/progress

**Expected Result:**
- Scene content matches expected (title, intro)
- Audio plays clearly without distortion
- Animations run smoothly (no stuttering)
- Progress indicator shows advancement
- Scene timing matches defined duration

**Pass/Fail:** [ ]

### Step 3: Automatic Scene Transitions
**Action:**
1. Let first scene play to completion
2. Observe transition to second scene
3. Monitor for any glitches during transition

**Expected Result:**
- Smooth transition between scenes
- No blank screen or flashing
- Audio transitions cleanly (no overlap/gap)
- Next scene loads immediately
- Progress bar updates correctly

**Pass/Fail:** [ ]

### Step 4: Manual Scene Navigation (if available)
**Action:**
1. Look for scene navigation controls
2. If present, click to jump to a different scene
3. Try jumping forward and backward

**Expected Result:**
- Scene jump executes immediately
- Content updates to selected scene
- Audio syncs with new position
- No residual content from previous scene
- Progress indicator updates

**Pass/Fail:** [ ]

### Step 5: Pause/Resume Functionality
**Action:**
1. Click pause button (or spacebar if supported)
2. Wait 5 seconds
3. Click play/resume
4. Repeat at different points in episode

**Expected Result:**
- Playback pauses immediately
- All animations freeze
- Audio stops cleanly
- Resume continues from exact pause point
- No audio/visual desync after resume

**Pass/Fail:** [ ]

### Step 6: Audio Controls Testing
**Action:**
1. Locate volume control
2. Adjust volume to 50%
3. Adjust to 0% (mute)
4. Adjust back to 100%
5. Test mute button separately

**Expected Result:**
- Volume changes are immediate
- Audio level corresponds to slider position
- Mute silences all audio
- Unmute returns to previous volume
- No audio artifacts during adjustment

**Pass/Fail:** [ ]

### Step 7: Progress Bar Interaction
**Action:**
1. Click on progress bar at different points
2. Drag progress indicator
3. Click near end of episode

**Expected Result:**
- Clicking jumps to that time point
- Dragging provides smooth scrubbing
- Content updates to match position
- No errors when seeking near boundaries
- Time display updates accurately

**Pass/Fail:** [ ]

### Step 8: Episode Completion
**Action:**
1. Skip to near end of episode
2. Let it play to completion
3. Observe end behavior

**Expected Result:**
- Final scene plays completely
- End screen or credits appear (if any)
- Options to replay or go to next episode
- Episode marked as watched in state
- No auto-advance without user action (unless designed)

**Pass/Fail:** [ ]

## Edge Cases

### Edge Case 1: Rapid Control Usage
**Action:**
1. Rapidly click pause/play multiple times
2. Quickly adjust volume up and down
3. Rapidly seek to different positions

**Expected Result:**
- Controls remain responsive
- No audio glitches or doubled playback
- UI doesn't freeze or lag
- State remains consistent

**Pass/Fail:** [ ]

### Edge Case 2: Browser Tab Switching
**Action:**
1. During playback, switch to another tab
2. Wait 10 seconds
3. Return to TechFlix tab

**Expected Result:**
- Playback continues or pauses gracefully
- No performance degradation
- Audio doesn't continue if paused
- Resumes normally when returning

**Pass/Fail:** [ ]

### Edge Case 3: Network Interruption Simulation
**Action:**
1. If episode loads assets dynamically:
2. Use DevTools to throttle network
3. Try to play episode sections

**Expected Result:**
- Graceful handling of slow loads
- Loading indicators where appropriate
- No crashes or frozen states
- Error messages if assets fail

**Pass/Fail:** [ ]
