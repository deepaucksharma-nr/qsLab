# Test Execution Report: TC002 - Episode Playback Core Functionality
**Test Track:** Functional  
**Priority:** High  
**Execution Date:** 2025-01-06
**Tester:** Manual Test Automation System

## Test Environment
- **Episode Tested:** S2E1 - Kafka Share Groups
- **Total Duration:** 32 minutes (1920 seconds)
- **Number of Scenes:** 4
- **Browser:** Chrome (simulated)

## Test Execution Results

### Step 1: Episode Initialization
**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIAL PASS
- Episode structure properly defined with 4 scenes
- Components load correctly
- **Issue:** Dual voice-over systems may cause initialization conflicts

### Step 2: Scene Playback Verification
**Status:** ‚ùå FAIL
- Scene components implement time-based progression
- **Critical Issue:** Two voice-over systems running simultaneously
- Manual segment triggering creates timing risks
- Animations and visual effects defined in components

### Step 3: Automatic Scene Transitions
**Status:** ‚úÖ PASS (with concerns)
- NetflixEpisodePlayer handles scene transitions based on duration
- 100ms update interval for smooth progression
- **Concern:** Audio cleanup issues during transitions

### Step 4: Manual Scene Navigation
**Status:** üîç REQUIRES VERIFICATION
- Scene jumping implemented in player
- Risk of audio state corruption when jumping

### Step 5: Pause/Resume Functionality
**Status:** ‚úÖ PASS
- NetflixEpisodePlayer implements play/pause
- State managed through isPlaying flag
- Timer properly stopped/started

### Step 6: Audio Controls Testing
**Status:** ‚ùå FAIL
- Volume controls implemented
- **Issue:** Dual audio systems may not respect same volume settings
- Mute functionality needs verification across both systems

### Step 7: Progress Bar Interaction
**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIAL PASS
- Progress tracking implemented
- Updates every 5 seconds to localStorage
- **Issue:** Manual voice-over triggers may not sync with progress jumps

### Step 8: Episode Completion
**Status:** ‚úÖ PASS
- Completion tracking implemented
- Progress saved to episode store
- End behavior properly defined

## Critical Issues Found

### BUG002: Dual Voice-Over Systems Conflict
**Severity:** High (P1)
**Description:** Two voice-over systems are running simultaneously:
1. Old system in NetflixEpisodePlayer using `audioManager.playVoiceOver()`
2. New system in scene components using `audioManager.playEpisodeVoiceoverSegment()`

**Impact:** 
- Potential double audio playback
- Conflicting state management
- Resource conflicts and performance issues

**Evidence:**
```javascript
// In NetflixEpisodePlayer.jsx:
audioManager.playVoiceOver(episode.id, scene.id);

// In EvolutionTimelineSceneV2.jsx:
audioManager.playEpisodeVoiceoverSegment('evolution-intro', ...);
```

### BUG003: Scene Audio Cleanup Affects All Scenes
**Severity:** High (P1)
**Description:** Scene components call `audioManager.cleanupEpisodeAudio()` on unmount, which clears ALL episode audio, not just the current scene's audio.

**Impact:**
- Audio stops prematurely during scene transitions
- Next scene's audio may fail to load
- Broken audio experience

**Evidence:**
```javascript
// In scene cleanup:
return () => {
  audioManager.cleanupEpisodeAudio();
};
```

### BUG004: Manual Voice-Over Timing
**Severity:** Medium (P2)
**Description:** Scenes manually calculate when to play voice-over segments based on progress percentages, creating timing fragility.

**Impact:**
- Voice-overs may play at wrong times
- Difficult to maintain and debug
- No synchronization with actual playback time

### BUG005: File Naming Convention Mismatch
**Severity:** Medium (P2)
**Description:** Voice-over file naming conventions don't match between old and new systems:
- Old: `/audio/voiceovers/s2e1/evolution.mp3`
- New: `/audio/voiceovers/s2e1/s2e1-evolution-evolution-intro.mp3`

**Impact:**
- 404 errors for missing audio files
- Broken voice-over playback
- Confusion in asset management

### BUG006: No Interactive Moments Defined
**Severity:** Low (P3)
**Description:** Episode has interactive system implemented but no `interactiveMoments` defined in episode data.

**Impact:**
- Interactive features unused
- Potential missed engagement opportunities

## Performance Observations
- 100ms update interval may impact performance with complex scenes
- Dual audio systems increase memory usage
- No audio preloading optimization

## Recommendations
1. **Immediate:** Disable one voice-over system to prevent conflicts
2. **High Priority:** Implement scene-specific audio cleanup
3. **Medium Priority:** Create automatic voice-over synchronization system
4. **Low Priority:** Add interactive moments to enhance engagement

## Test Evidence
- ‚úÖ Code analysis completed
- ‚úÖ Component structure verified
- ‚úÖ Audio system architecture reviewed
- ‚ùå Runtime behavior requires manual verification
- ‚ùå Performance metrics need browser testing

## Overall Test Result
**Status:** ‚ùå FAIL

**Summary:** Episode playback has critical architectural issues with dual voice-over systems causing potential conflicts. While basic playback functionality exists, the audio system conflicts make the experience unreliable. Immediate remediation required before production use.

---
**Next Steps:**
1. Fix dual voice-over system conflict
2. Implement proper scene-specific audio cleanup
3. Create automated tests for audio synchronization
4. Perform manual browser testing to verify fixes
