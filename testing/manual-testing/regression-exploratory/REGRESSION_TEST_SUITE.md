## Regression Test Guidelines

### When to Run
1. **Smoke Tests**
   - After every deployment
   - Before starting full regression
   - After critical bug fixes

2. **Core Regression**
   - Before any release
   - Weekly during active development
   - After major feature additions

3. **Full Regression**
   - Before major releases
   - Monthly maintenance
   - After architectural changes

### Test Prioritization
1. Always run smoke tests first
2. If smoke fails, stop and report
3. Run core regression by priority
4. Run full regression if time permits

### Reporting
1. Update this document with results
2. File bugs for any failures
3. Link bug numbers in the log
4. Provide summary to team

### Environment Setup
1. Clear browser cache
2. Use fresh user profile
3. Close other applications
4. Disable browser extensions
5. Use consistent test data
