## 3. Memory Performance Visualization

### Before Optimizations
```
Memory Usage over 30min playback:
Start: 120MB
10min: 280MB ↗️ (Memory leak)
20min: 420MB ↗️ (Continuous growth)
30min: 580MB ↗️ (Performance degradation)
```

### After Optimizations
```
Memory Usage over 30min playback:
Start: 120MB
10min: 180MB ↗️ (Normal growth)
20min: 185MB → (Stabilized)
30min: 190MB → (Garbage collected)
```

### Visual Indicators
- [ ] **No gradual slowdown**: Performance consistent
- [ ] **GC pauses minimal**: No visible stutters
- [ ] **Scene cleanup working**: Memory drops between scenes

## 4. Network Performance Impact

### Asset Loading Visualization

#### Progressive Loading
- [ ] **Blur-up images**: Low quality → High quality
- [ ] **Skeleton screens**: Show during load
- [ ] **Staggered animations**: Content appears sequentially
- [ ] **No pop-in**: Smooth appearance

#### Bandwidth Optimization
- **Before**: All assets load immediately (8MB)
- **After**: Lazy loading implemented (2MB initial)
- **Visual Impact**: Faster perceived performance
