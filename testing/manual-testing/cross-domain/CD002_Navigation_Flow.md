## Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Complete User Journey

#### Test Steps
1. **Landing to Episode Flow**
   - Start at home (/)
   - Click episode card
   - Verify URL changes
   - Play episode partially
   - Use back button
   - Verify home state

2. **Deep Navigation**
   - Home → Episode → Quiz
   - Complete quiz
   - Back to episode
   - Back to home
   - Forward through history

3. **Cross-Season Navigation**
   - Navigate S1E1
   - Jump to S2E1 directly
   - Check state cleanup
   - Verify no content mixing

**Expected Results:**
- [ ] URLs update correctly
- [ ] Back/forward works
- [ ] State preserved appropriately
- [ ] No content contamination
- [ ] Smooth transitions

**Pass/Fail:** [ ]

### Scenario 2: URL Parameter Integration

#### Test Steps
1. **Direct URL Access**
   - Navigate to: /episodes/s2e1
   - Verify episode loads
   - Check for missing data
   - Test with debug=true

2. **Parameter Preservation**
   - Start with ?debug=true
   - Navigate through app
   - Verify parameter persists
   - Check all navigation methods

3. **Invalid Routes**
   - Try /episodes/s99e99
   - Try /invalid-page
   - Verify error handling
   - Check redirect behavior

**Expected Results:**
- [ ] Direct URLs work
- [ ] Parameters preserved
- [ ] 404 handling correct
- [ ] No blank pages
- [ ] Graceful fallbacks

**Pass/Fail:** [ ]

### Scenario 3: Component Lifecycle

#### Test Steps
1. **Mount/Unmount Tracking**
   - Open debug logs
   - Navigate between pages
   - Monitor component lifecycle
   - Check for memory leaks

2. **Resource Cleanup**
   - Start episode with audio
   - Navigate away quickly
   - Verify audio stops
   - Check timers cleared

3. **Rapid Navigation**
   - Click multiple episodes fast
   - Use back button rapidly
   - Navigate during loading
   - Check final state

**Expected Results:**
- [ ] Clean mounting/unmounting
- [ ] Resources properly cleaned
- [ ] No zombie components
- [ ] Audio/video stops
- [ ] Stable under stress

**Pass/Fail:** [ ]

### Scenario 4: State During Navigation

#### Test Steps
1. **Form State Preservation**
   - Start quiz
   - Fill partial answers
   - Navigate away (accident)
   - Return to quiz
   - Check if preserved

2. **Playback State**
   - Play episode to 50%
   - Navigate to home
   - Click different episode
   - Return to first
   - Verify correct position

3. **Settings Changes**
   - Change audio settings
   - Navigate around app
   - Verify settings stick
   - Check after history nav

**Expected Results:**
- [ ] Form state handled properly
- [ ] Playback positions correct
- [ ] Settings remain stable
- [ ] No unexpected resets
- [ ] Consistent behavior

**Pass/Fail:** [ ]

### Scenario 5: Complex Navigation Patterns

#### Test Steps
1. **Tab Navigation**
   - Open episode in new tab
   - Make changes in tab 1
   - Navigate in tab 2
   - Check state isolation

2. **Bookmark Testing**
   - Bookmark episode URL
   - Clear session
   - Use bookmark
   - Verify loads correctly

3. **History Manipulation**
   - Use history.go(-2)
   - Test history.go(1)
   - Try browser shortcuts
   - Verify app syncs

**Expected Results:**
- [ ] Multi-tab works correctly
- [ ] Bookmarks functional
- [ ] History API integration
- [ ] No navigation breaks
- [ ] State consistency

**Pass/Fail:** [ ]
