- [x] Screenshot tools prepared
- [x] Test charters reviewed
- [x] Previous bug reports reviewed

## Exploratory Testing Log

### 1. Initial Application Load (18:15)

**Charter:** First Impressions - New User Experience

**Observations:**
- Application loads at http://localhost:3002/
- Initial load time: ~2 seconds
- No console errors on load
- Dark theme properly applied

**Visual Inspection:**
- Netflix-style dark background (#0A0A0A)
- TechFlix branding visible in header
- Episode cards display in grid layout
- Smooth fade-in animation on load

**Issues Found:**
- None on initial load

### 2. Home Page Layout Testing (18:20)

**Charter:** Visual Consistency Check

**Test Actions:**
1. Inspected episode card grid at 1920x1080
2. Checked hover states on episode cards
3. Verified season organization
4. Tested responsive behavior (1920px → 1280px → 1024px)

**Visual Findings:**
- ✅ Episode cards maintain 16:9 aspect ratio
- ✅ Hover effect scales cards to 1.05x smoothly
- ✅ Season headers clearly visible with proper spacing
- ✅ Grid adjusts from 4 → 3 → 2 columns responsively

**Performance Notes:**
- Hover animations smooth (60 FPS)
- No layout shift during resize
- Images load progressively

### 3. Episode Navigation Testing (18:30)

**Charter:** Speed Clicking Marathon + Navigation Chaos

**Test Actions:**
1. Rapid-clicked between multiple episode cards
2. Used browser back/forward buttons rapidly
3. Opened episodes in multiple tabs
4. Tested deep linking to specific episodes

**Results:**
- Rapid clicking handled gracefully - no double navigation
- Browser history maintained correctly
- Multiple tabs work independently
- Deep links work: `/episode/s2e1-kafka-share-groups` loads correctly

**Edge Case Found:**
- Opening 5+ episodes in tabs simultaneously causes slight performance degradation
- Memory usage increases to ~450MB per tab

### 4. Episode Player Visual Testing (18:40)

**Charter:** Cinematic Experience Validation

**Episode Tested:** S2E1 - Kafka Share Groups

**Visual Elements Checked:**
- [x] Player controls overlay positioning
- [x] Scene transition effects
- [x] Particle animations
- [x] Text readability over backgrounds
- [x] Code syntax highlighting

**Observations:**
- Controls auto-hide after 3 seconds
- Smooth opacity transitions between scenes
- Particle effects render at consistent FPS
- Code blocks use appropriate monospace font
- Good contrast on all text elements

**Screenshot Evidence:**
- Player controls visible: Clean Netflix-style bottom bar
- Scene transition: Smooth fade between scenes
- Interactive prompt: Well-styled quiz interface

### 5. Audio System Testing (18:50)

**Charter:** Audio Torture Test

**Test Sequence:**
1. Toggled VoiceOver on/off 20 times rapidly
2. Adjusted volume slider continuously while playing
3. Muted/unmuted during scene transitions
4. Tested audio persistence across episodes

**Results:**
- ✅ VoiceOver toggle handles rapid clicking (debounced)
- ✅ Volume changes apply smoothly without pops
- ✅ Mute state persists correctly
- ✅ No audio overlap during transitions
- ✅ Settings persist in localStorage

**Audio Quality:**
- Clear narration without distortion
- Appropriate volume levels
- Good audio synchronization with visuals

### 6. Interactive Elements Testing (19:00)

**Charter:** The Confused Newcomer

**Approach:** Act as if I've never seen the platform before

**Test Actions:**
1. Clicked on non-interactive elements expecting response
2. Tried to skip required quiz questions
3. Attempted to navigate during locked interactions
4. Explored all clickable areas

**Findings:**
- Quiz validation works well - prevents empty submissions
- Clear visual feedback for interactive vs non-interactive
- Good error messages for invalid inputs
- Navigation through UI mostly works well

**Visual Issue:**
- Some interactive buttons lack hover states
- Navigation breadcrumbs not available

### 7. Performance Monitoring (19:15)

**Charter:** Animation Performance Hunt

**Test Conditions:**
- CPU throttled to 4x slowdown
- Multiple heavy scenes loaded
- Debug panel open

**Performance Metrics:**
- Initial page load: 2.1s
- Scene transitions: 150-200ms
- Heavy animation scenes: 28-35 FPS (acceptable)
- Memory usage: 180MB baseline, peaks at 320MB

**Bottlenecks Identified:**
- Particle-heavy scenes cause frame drops on throttled CPU
- Multiple animated elements can stack performance cost
- Debug panel adds ~10% overhead

### 8. New Episode Content Testing (19:30)

**Episodes Tested:**
- S2E5: Critical Metrics - Key Shifts
- S2E6: Data Ingestion Paths  
- S2E7: Kafka Evolution and Limits

**Content Quality:**
- All episodes load correctly
- Scene components render properly
- Interactive elements function
- Navigation between new episodes smooth

**Visual Consistency:**
- New episodes match existing design language
- Consistent use of color scheme
- Animation patterns maintained
- Typography uniform

### 9. Debug Panel Exploration (19:45)

**Charter:** Console Error Detective

**Debug Panel Features Tested:**
- Log filtering by level
- Search functionality
- Performance metrics display
- State inspection
- Log export

**Findings:**
- ✅ Ctrl+Shift+D toggle works reliably
- ✅ Real-time log updates functional
- ✅ Search filters logs correctly
- ✅ Export generates valid JSON
- ⚠️ Minor UI overlap with player controls when both visible

### 10. Edge Case Exploration (20:00)

**Charter:** Storage Limit Explorer

**Test Actions:**
1. Filled localStorage near capacity
2. Tested with cookies disabled
3. Used incognito mode
4. Cleared storage during playback

**Results:**
- App handles storage quota gracefully
- Falls back to session-only when storage blocked
- Incognito mode works but loses progress
- Storage clear during playback handled without crash
