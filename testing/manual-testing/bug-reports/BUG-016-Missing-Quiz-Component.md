# Bug Report: BUG007 - Missing Quiz Component Causes Runtime Error

**Date:** 2025-01-06  
**Reporter:** Manual Test Automation  
**Test Case:** TC003 - Interactive Elements  
**Severity:** Critical (P0)  
**Priority:** Urgent  
**Status:** Open  
**Component:** Interactive System  

## Summary
Season 2 Episode 5 defines a quiz interaction that references a non-existent 'quiz' component type, which will cause a runtime error when users reach the 90-second mark in the episode.

## Environment
- **Affected Episode:** S2E5 - Critical Metrics
- **Timestamp:** 90 seconds into episode
- **Component:** NetflixEpisodePlayer interactive system

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Navigate to Season 2, Episode 5
2. Start episode playback
3. Wait for or skip to 90-second mark
4. Application will attempt to render quiz component
5. Runtime error occurs

## Expected Behavior
- Episode pauses at 90 seconds
- Quiz interface appears with question and options
- User can select answer and submit
- Feedback provided on answer correctness
- Episode continues after interaction

## Actual Behavior
- Episode reaches 90-second mark
- Player attempts to render 'quiz' component
- Component undefined in interactiveComponents mapping
- JavaScript error thrown
- Episode playback broken

## Code Evidence
```javascript
// In season2/ep5-critical-metrics/index.js:
interactiveMoments: [
  {
    timestamp: 90,
    type: 'quiz',  // This type has no corresponding component
    data: {
      question: "Which Kafka metric indicates the number of messages waiting to be consumed?",
      options: [
        "Consumer Lag",
        "Producer Rate", 
        "Replication Factor",
        "Partition Count"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 0
    }
  }
]

// In NetflixEpisodePlayer.jsx (line 57-59):
const interactiveComponents = {
  'state-machine': InteractiveStateMachine,
  // Missing: 'quiz': QuizComponent
};

// When player tries to render (line 346):
const Component = interactiveComponents[interactiveMoment.type];
// Component will be undefined for 'quiz' type
```

## Error Details
```
TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'type')
  at NetflixEpisodePlayer.jsx:346
```

## Impact Analysis
- **User Impact:** 100% of users watching S2E5 will encounter error
- **Severity:** Complete breakage of episode playback
- **Business Impact:** Poor user experience, potential user churn
- **Data Loss:** Episode progress may be lost

## Root Cause
Interactive quiz feature was designed and configured in episode data but the actual React component was never implemented.

## Recommended Fix
**Option 1 (Quick Fix):** Remove quiz interaction from S2E5
```javascript
// Remove or comment out interactiveMoments array
```

**Option 2 (Proper Fix):** Implement quiz component
```javascript
// Create QuizComponent.jsx
// Add to interactiveComponents mapping:
const interactiveComponents = {
  'state-machine': InteractiveStateMachine,
  'quiz': QuizComponent
};
```

## Workaround
Users cannot work around this issue. They must skip the episode or stop at 89 seconds.

## Related Issues
- BUG008: Interactive system underutilized
- Missing components for other interaction types
- No test coverage for interactive components

## Test Coverage
- No unit tests for interactive component mapping
- No integration tests for episode playback
- Manual testing would have caught this immediately

## Regression Risk
- Low risk for quick fix (removing interaction)
- Medium risk for proper fix (new component needs testing)
