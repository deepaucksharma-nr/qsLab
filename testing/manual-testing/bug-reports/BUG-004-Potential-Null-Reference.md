# Bug Report: Potential Null Reference in Episode Mapping

## Bug Information
- **Bug ID**: BUG-004
- **Date Discovered**: June 2, 2025
- **Severity**: Low
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Status**: Open
- **Reporter**: Testing Assistant

## Summary
The EnhancedEpisodesSectionFixed component calls `season.episodes.map()` without checking if `season.episodes` exists, which could cause a runtime error if the data structure is modified or corrupted.

## Technical Details

### Issue Location
**File**: `src/components/EnhancedEpisodesSectionFixed.jsx`  
**Line**: ~88

### Current Implementation:
```javascript
seasons.forEach(season => {
  transformed[season.number] = season.episodes.map(episode => 
    transformEpisodeData(episode, season.number)
  );
});
```

### Potential Problem
If `season.episodes` is `null`, `undefined`, or not an array, the call to `.map()` will throw a TypeError:
- `TypeError: Cannot read property 'map' of undefined`
- `TypeError: season.episodes.map is not a function`

## Risk Assessment
- **Current Risk**: Low (data structure is currently well-defined)
- **Future Risk**: Medium (could break if data source changes)
- **Defensive Programming**: This should be fixed as a best practice

## Impact
- **Runtime Error**: Could crash the component if data is malformed
- **User Experience**: Would show error boundary instead of episodes
- **Debugging**: Makes the app less resilient to data changes

## Fix Applied
**Date**: June 2, 2025  
**Status**: FIXED ✅

### Changes Made:
1. **Added defensive check**: Verified `season.episodes` exists and is an array before calling `.map()`
2. **Added logger import**: Imported logger utility for warning messages
3. **Added fallback**: Empty array fallback when episodes array is missing
4. **Added logging**: Warning message when season data is malformed

### Fixed Implementation:
```javascript
// Before (Potential crash):
seasons.forEach(season => {
  transformed[season.number] = season.episodes.map(episode => 
    transformEpisodeData(episode, season.number)
  );
});

// After (Defensive):
seasons.forEach(season => {
  if (season && season.episodes && Array.isArray(season.episodes)) {
    transformed[season.number] = season.episodes.map(episode => 
      transformEpisodeData(episode, season.number)
    );
  } else {
    logger.warn('Season missing episodes array', { seasonNumber: season?.number });
    transformed[season.number] = [];
  }
});
```

### Benefits:
- ✅ Prevents potential runtime crashes
- ✅ Provides helpful debugging information
- ✅ Graceful degradation with empty array fallback
- ✅ Better resilience to data format changes

**Resolution**: Added defensive programming practices to prevent null reference errors.
