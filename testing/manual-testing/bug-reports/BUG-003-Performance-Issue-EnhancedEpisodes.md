# Bug Report: Performance Issue in EnhancedEpisodesSectionFixed

## Bug Information
- **Bug ID**: BUG-003
- **Date Discovered**: June 2, 2025
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Status**: Open
- **Reporter**: Testing Assistant

## Summary
The EnhancedEpisodesSectionFixed component has performance issues due to unnecessary function recreations and expensive operations running on every render.

## Technical Details

### Issue 1: Function Recreation on Every Render
The `getContinueWatching` function is defined inside the component without `useCallback`, causing it to be recreated on every render.

### Issue 2: Expensive Operation in Render
The `getContinueWatching()` function is called directly in the render phase without memoization, causing:
- localStorage access on every render
- Array operations and filtering on every render
- Date parsing on every render

### Code Location
**File**: `src/components/EnhancedEpisodesSectionFixed.jsx`  
**Lines**: ~95-110

### Current Implementation:
```javascript
const getContinueWatching = () => {
  const continueWatching = [];
  Object.entries(transformedData).forEach(([_seasonNumber, episodes]) => {
    episodes.forEach(episode => {
      if (episode.progress.percentComplete > 0 && episode.progress.percentComplete < 95) {
        continueWatching.push(episode);
      }
    });
  });
  return continueWatching.sort((a, b) => {
    const dateA = new Date(a.progress.watchedDate || 0);
    const dateB = new Date(b.progress.watchedDate || 0);
    return dateB - dateA;
  });
};

const continueWatchingEpisodes = getContinueWatching(); // Called on every render
```

## Impact
- **Performance**: Unnecessary re-computations on every component render
- **User Experience**: Potential UI lag, especially with large episode lists
- **Resource Usage**: Excessive localStorage access and memory allocations
- **Battery Life**: Increased CPU usage on mobile devices

## Fix Applied
**Date**: June 2, 2025  
**Status**: FIXED ✅

### Changes Made:
1. **Added React imports**: Added `useCallback` and `useMemo` to imports
2. **Optimized getContinueWatching**: Converted to memoized `continueWatchingEpisodes` using `useMemo`
3. **Removed redundant function call**: Eliminated the direct function call that ran on every render

### Optimized Implementation:
```javascript
// Before (Performance Issue):
const getContinueWatching = () => { /* expensive operations */ };
const continueWatchingEpisodes = getContinueWatching(); // Runs every render

// After (Optimized):
const continueWatchingEpisodes = useMemo(() => {
  /* expensive operations - only runs when transformedData changes */
}, [transformedData]);
```

### Performance Improvements:
- ✅ Function only runs when `transformedData` changes
- ✅ No more localStorage access on every render
- ✅ Reduced CPU usage and memory allocations
- ✅ Better user experience with smoother UI

### Testing Required:
- [ ] Verify continue watching section still displays correctly
- [ ] Confirm performance improvement in DevTools
- [ ] Test with large episode lists
- [ ] Check memory usage doesn't grow over time

**Resolution**: Performance issue resolved through proper React optimization patterns.
