# Bug Report: Inconsistent State Management Architecture

## Bug Information
- **Bug ID**: BUG-008
- **Date Discovered**: June 2, 2025
- **Severity**: High
- **Priority**: High
- **Status**: Open
- **Reporter**: Testing Assistant

## Summary
The application uses two different state management systems simultaneously - React Context (in App.jsx) and Zustand store (in SearchPage and other components), which can lead to state synchronization issues and inconsistent behavior.

## Technical Details

### Components Using React Context (AppContext):
- ✅ `App.jsx` - Main state provider
- ✅ `EnhancedEpisodesSectionFixed.jsx`
- ✅ `HeroSection.jsx`
- ✅ `EpisodesSection.jsx`

### Components Using Zustand Store (useEpisodeStore):
- ❌ `SearchPage.jsx`
- ❌ `SeriesPage.jsx`
- ❌ `EpisodePage.jsx`

### State Variables in Both Systems:
```javascript
// React Context (App.jsx):
- currentSeason, setCurrentSeason
- currentEpisode, setCurrentEpisode
- seasons, isLoading, error

// Zustand Store (episodeStore.js):
- currentSeason, setCurrentSeason
- currentEpisode, setCurrentEpisode
- seasons, isLoading, error
```

## Potential Issues
1. **State Desynchronization**: Changes in one system don't update the other
2. **Race Conditions**: Two systems might overwrite each other's state
3. **Data Inconsistency**: Different components might see different data
4. **Memory Leaks**: Duplicate state management increases memory usage
5. **Developer Confusion**: Unclear which state system to use for new components

## Impact
- **Functionality**: Search results might not reflect current episode state
- **Navigation**: Episode selection might not work consistently across pages
- **User Experience**: Inconsistent behavior between different app sections
- **Maintenance**: Complex debugging due to dual state systems

## Recommended Solution
This is a significant architectural issue that requires careful refactoring. Options include:

### Option 1: Migrate to Zustand Store (Recommended)
- Remove React Context from App.jsx
- Update all Context-using components to use Zustand
- Benefits: Better performance, less boilerplate, persistence support

### Option 2: Remove Zustand Store  
- Update SearchPage and other store-using components to use Context
- Remove Zustand store entirely
- Benefits: Simpler architecture, single state system

### Option 3: Create State Bridge
- Sync between Context and Store with useEffect
- Temporary solution until proper migration

## Status: DOCUMENTED ⚠️
This issue requires architectural refactoring beyond the scope of basic bug fixing. Documented for future development planning.

**Priority**: Should be addressed in next development cycle to prevent future state-related bugs.
