# Potential Issues - Kafka Share Groups Episode

## Document Information
- **Episode**: Season 2, Episode 1 - Kafka Share Groups
- **Created**: 2025-06-02
- **Purpose**: Guide testers on common issues to watch for

## High-Risk Areas for Bugs

### 1. Scene Transition Issues
**Common Problems:**
- **Black screen between scenes** - Scenes may not load properly at transition points (8:00, 16:00, 26:00)
- **Audio/video desync** - Narration may continue while visual freezes
- **Overlap rendering** - Previous scene elements may persist into next scene
- **Memory leaks** - Scene components not properly unmounting

**Watch for:**
- Console errors at transition timestamps
- Performance degradation over time
- Visual glitches during transitions

### 2. Complex Visualization Bugs

#### Evolution Timeline Scene (EvolutionTimelineSceneV2)
**Potential Issues:**
- Timeline points not animating in sequence
- Text labels overlapping or cut off
- Particle effects causing performance issues
- Historical data not displaying correctly
- Animation timing off with narration

#### Share Groups Architecture Scene
**Potential Issues:**
- Architecture diagram components not rendering
- Connection lines between components missing
- Labels unreadable at certain zoom levels
- Interactive elements not responding
- Complex SVGs causing browser lag

### 3. Player Control Bugs
**Common Problems:**
- **Scrubbing issues** - Jumping to specific time causes scene state corruption
- **Pause/resume bugs** - Animations restart instead of resuming
- **Progress tracking** - Incorrect time saved to localStorage
- **Control overlay** - Controls not hiding after timeout
- **Fullscreen problems** - Layout breaks in fullscreen mode

### 4. Performance-Related Issues
**Watch for:**
- **Memory usage** increasing steadily (memory leak)
- **Frame drops** during complex animations
- **CPU spikes** during scene transitions
- **Asset loading failures** causing missing visuals
- **Browser tab crashes** on lower-end devices

### 5. State Management Bugs
**Potential Issues:**
- Progress not saving correctly
- Episode marked complete prematurely
- Continue watching shows wrong timestamp
- Scene state not resetting on replay
- Interactive element states persisting incorrectly

### 6. Edge Case Scenarios

#### Network-Related
- Slow loading causing scene timing issues
- Partial asset loads breaking visualizations
- Network interruption during playback
- CDN failures for large assets

#### Browser-Specific
- Chrome vs Firefox rendering differences
- Safari animation performance issues
- Mobile browser compatibility
- Browser extension conflicts

#### User Behavior
- Rapid clicking causing state corruption
- Multiple tabs playing same episode
- Browser refresh during critical animations
- Switching episodes mid-playback

## Bug Severity Guidelines

### Critical (P0) - Block Release
- Episode won't load or crashes
- Data loss (progress not saved)
- Browser tab crashes consistently
- Security vulnerabilities exposed

### High (P1) - Fix Before Release
- Major scenes don't render
- Audio completely out of sync
- Interactive elements broken
- Performance makes episode unwatchable

### Medium (P2) - Fix Soon
- Minor visual glitches
- Occasional animation stutters
- Non-critical features broken
- Workarounds available

### Low (P3) - Nice to Fix
- Cosmetic issues
- Minor text alignment
- Enhancement requests
- Edge case scenarios

## Testing Tips

1. **Always test with DevTools open** - Monitor console, network, and performance
2. **Test at different playback speeds** - Use browser speed controls
3. **Test with different network speeds** - Use Chrome throttling
4. **Clear cache between tests** - Ensure fresh state
5. **Document exact timestamps** - Critical for reproduction
6. **Take screenshots/recordings** - Visual evidence crucial
7. **Note system resources** - CPU/RAM usage matters

## Known Issues to Verify Fixed
Based on similar episode types:
- Scene transitions at exactly 8:00 mark may stutter
- Architecture diagrams may not scale properly on 4K displays
- Particle effects in timeline scene may cause GPU acceleration issues
- Skip forward during transitions may cause blank screen

## Regression Test Points
If code changes are made, verify:
1. All four scenes still load and play
2. Total duration remains exactly 32 minutes
3. Interactive elements still respond
4. Progress tracking still works
5. No new console errors introduced
6. Performance hasn't degraded
