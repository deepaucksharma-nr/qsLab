# Week 4: The Detective - Debugging & Troubleshooting

## 🎯 This Week's Mission

Become a Kafka debugging expert. Learn to diagnose issues quickly using metrics, logs, and distributed tracing.

## 📚 Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, you will:
- ✅ Build debugging runbooks with metrics
- ✅ Correlate metrics with logs effectively  
- ✅ Implement distributed tracing for Kafka
- ✅ Create intelligent alerts
- ✅ Perform root cause analysis

## 🗓️ Week Structure

### Day 1-2: Debugging Fundamentals
- Common Kafka issues and their signatures
- Building a metrics-based runbook
- Log analysis techniques

### Day 3-4: Advanced Troubleshooting
- Consumer lag investigation
- Partition skew problems
- Network and connectivity issues

### Day 5: Proactive Monitoring
- Alert design and thresholds
- Anomaly detection
- Automated remediation

## 🛠️ Planned Labs

### Lab 1: The Case of the Missing Messages
Investigate why messages are not reaching consumers

### Lab 2: Consumer Lag Mystery
Debug and resolve consumer lag issues

### Lab 3: Performance Degradation
Find root cause of cluster slowdown

## 🔍 Key Debugging Metrics

```sql
-- Consumer Lag Investigation
FROM KafkaConsumerSample
SELECT max(consumer.lag) as 'Max Lag',
       average(consumer.messageRate) as 'Consumption Rate'
FACET consumer_group, topic
WHERE consumer.lag > 1000

-- Broker Health Check  
FROM KafkaBrokerSample
SELECT average(broker.IOWaitPercent) as 'IO Wait',
       average(request.avgTimeMs) as 'Avg Request Time'
WHERE broker.IOWaitPercent > 50
```
