# Week 5: The Architect - Platform Design

## 🎯 This Week's Mission

Design and implement a complete Kafka observability platform. Apply everything learned to architect a production-ready monitoring solution.

## 📚 Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, you will:
- ✅ Design comprehensive observability architecture
- ✅ Implement multi-cluster monitoring
- ✅ Create executive dashboards
- ✅ Build capacity planning tools
- ✅ Document operational procedures

## 🗓️ Week Structure

### Day 1-2: Architecture Design
- Observability requirements gathering
- Architecture patterns
- Technology selection

### Day 3-4: Implementation
- Multi-cluster setup
- Dashboard creation
- Alert framework

### Day 5: Documentation & Handover
- Runbook creation
- Knowledge transfer
- Future roadmap

## 🛠️ Capstone Project

### Design a Complete Observability Platform

Your challenge: Design monitoring for a hypothetical company with:
- 5 Kafka clusters across 3 regions
- 100+ topics, 50+ consumer groups
- 1TB daily data volume
- 99.95% uptime SLA
- 15-minute RPO/RTO requirements

### Deliverables

1. **Architecture Document**
   - Metrics collection strategy
   - Data retention policies
   - Dashboard hierarchy
   - Alert framework

2. **Implementation Plan**
   - Rollout phases
   - Resource requirements
   - Risk mitigation

3. **Operational Guide**
   - Daily procedures  
   - Incident response
   - Capacity planning
