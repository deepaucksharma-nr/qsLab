# Week 3: The Optimizer - Performance & Scale

## 🎯 This Week's Mission

Master Kafka performance optimization through observability. Learn to identify bottlenecks, tune configurations, and scale efficiently.

## 📚 Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, you will:
- ✅ Identify performance bottlenecks using metrics
- ✅ Optimize broker configurations based on data
- ✅ Implement performance testing with monitoring
- ✅ Create performance dashboards and alerts
- ✅ Understand scaling patterns and their metrics

## 🗓️ Week Structure

### Day 1-2: Performance Baselines
- Establishing performance baselines
- Key performance indicators (KPIs)
- Load testing with monitoring

### Day 3-4: Bottleneck Analysis
- Identifying system bottlenecks
- Correlating metrics with performance
- Root cause analysis techniques

### Day 5: Optimization Strategies
- Configuration tuning
- Hardware optimization
- Scaling decisions

## 🛠️ Hands-On Labs

### Lab 1: Performance Baseline
**Duration**: 2 hours  
**Goal**: Establish performance baselines for your Kafka cluster

Coming soon...

### Lab 2: Bottleneck Hunt
**Duration**: 2 hours  
**Goal**: Identify and resolve a performance bottleneck

Coming soon...

### Lab 3: Optimization Challenge
**Duration**: 3 hours  
**Goal**: Optimize cluster for specific workload patterns

Coming soon...

## 📖 Required Reading

1. [Kafka Performance Tuning](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#performance)
2. [Enhanced Journey Part 3](../../docs/02-advanced/enhanced-learning-journey-part3.md)
3. Performance analysis techniques

## 🎯 Week 3 Deliverables

By the end of this week, you should have:
1. ✅ Performance baseline documentation
2. ✅ Bottleneck analysis report
3. ✅ Optimization recommendations
4. ✅ Performance dashboard in New Relic

## 💡 Key Metrics for Performance

- **Throughput**: Messages/sec, Bytes/sec
- **Latency**: Request latency, E2E latency
- **Saturation**: CPU, Memory, Disk I/O, Network
- **Errors**: Failed requests, Timeouts

## 🚀 Coming Soon

This week's content is under development. Check back soon for:
- Detailed exercises
- Performance testing scripts
- Analysis tools
- Real-world scenarios

## 📊 Preview: Performance Testing Script

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Performance test with monitoring

echo "Starting performance test..."

# Record start metrics
START_TIME=$(date +%s)
START_MESSAGES=$(docker exec kafka-xray-broker \
  kafka-run-class kafka.tools.JmxTool \
  --object-name kafka.server:type=BrokerTopicMetrics,name=MessagesInPerSec \
  --attributes OneMinuteRate)

# Run load test
docker exec kafka-xray-broker kafka-producer-perf-test \
  --topic perf-test \
  --num-records 1000000 \
  --record-size 1024 \
  --throughput 10000 \
  --producer-props bootstrap.servers=localhost:9092

# Analyze results
# ... (full script coming soon)
```
