## 🗺️ Your Learning Path

### Phase 0: Foundation Calibration ✅
- [Mental Models](docs/00-foundation/mental-models.md) - Building on your API server analogy
- [Core Concepts](docs/00-foundation/core-concepts.md) - Kafka entities and observability categories

### Phase 1: X-Ray Vision 🔬
- [Week 1 Lab](labs/week1-xray/README.md) - Trace metrics from JMX to New Relic
- [Architecture Deep Dive](docs/01-architecture/nri-kafka-architecture.md) - Understanding every component

### Phase 2: The Builder 🛠️
- [Week 2 Lab](labs/week2-builder/README.md) - Create custom metrics and OHI extensions
- [OHI Development Guide](docs/02-advanced/ohi-development.md) - Building production-ready integrations

### Phase 3: The Optimizer ⚡
- [Week 3 Lab](labs/week3-optimizer/README.md) - Handle 1000+ topic clusters
- [Performance Patterns](docs/02-advanced/performance-patterns.md) - Optimization strategies

### Phase 4: The Detective 🔍
- [Week 4 Lab](labs/week4-detective/README.md) - Debug missing metrics and discrepancies
- [Troubleshooting Guide](debugging-toolkit/README.md) - Your debugging toolkit

### Phase 5: The Architect 🏗️
- [Week 5 Lab](labs/week5-architect/README.md) - Design complete observability platforms
- [Architecture Patterns](architecture-designs/README.md) - Enterprise patterns

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Today's Mission: Your First X-Ray Exercise

```bash
# 1. Navigate to Week 1 lab
cd labs/week1-xray

# 2. Start the Docker environment
docker-compose up -d

# 3. Follow the exercise
# Complete instructions in labs/week1-xray/exercise-01-metric-xray.md
```

## 📊 Progress Tracking

- [ ] Week 1: Foundation - Understand the plumbing
- [ ] Week 2: Builder - Create custom metrics  
- [ ] Week 3: Optimizer - Handle scale challenges
- [ ] Week 4: Detective - Master debugging
- [ ] Week 5: Architect - Design complete solutions

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

- Docker Desktop installed
- Basic Go knowledge (for OHI extensions)
- Access to New Relic account
- Curiosity and willingness to experiment

## 📖 Learning Philosophy

This repository follows a **first-principles, hands-on approach**:

1. **See it work** - Observe real metrics flowing
2. **Understand why** - Trace the implementation
3. **Build it yourself** - Create custom solutions
4. **Break it** - Learn from failures
5. **Fix it** - Develop debugging skills
6. **Scale it** - Handle production challenges

## 🤝 Contributing

This is your personal learning repository. Feel free to:
- Add your own experiments
- Document your discoveries
- Create new debugging scenarios
- Share your architectural designs

## 📚 Additional Resources

- [New Relic Kafka Integration Docs](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/kafka/kafka-integration/)

- [OHI SDK Documentation](https://github.com/newrelic/infra-integrations-sdk)

## 🎯 Your Next Steps

1. **Complete Week 1 Exercise 1** - Trace your first metric (45 minutes)
2. **Set up your learning log** - Track insights and questions
3. **Join the journey** - Commit to 1 hour daily for maximum impact
