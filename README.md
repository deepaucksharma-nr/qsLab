## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Docker Desktop installed and running
- Git configured
- Basic Go knowledge (for advanced exercises)
- New Relic account (free tier works)

### Your First Steps

1. **Quick Validation** (5 minutes)
   ```bash
   cd labs/week1-xray
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

2. **First Exercise** (45 minutes)
   - Complete [Exercise 1: Metric X-Ray](labs/week1-xray/exercise-01-metric-xray.md)

3. **Track Progress**
   - Update [PROGRESS.md](PROGRESS.md) after each exercise
   - Log insights in [LEARNING_LOG.md](LEARNING_LOG.md)
## 📖 Learning Philosophy

This repository follows a **first-principles, hands-on approach**:

1. **See it work** - Observe real metrics flowing
2. **Understand why** - Trace the implementation
3. **Build it yourself** - Create custom solutions
4. **Break it** - Learn from failures
5. **Fix it** - Develop debugging skills
6. **Scale it** - Handle production challenges
