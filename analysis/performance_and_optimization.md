# Performance and Optimization Analysis: TechFlix

## Current Optimization Measures

* **Vite Configuration**: The project uses Vite 5 with manual chunk splitting and terser minification. Vendor libraries and episode content are separated into dedicated chunks for better caching and smaller initial loads. A PWA plugin provides a service worker and runtime caching for external assets like Google Fonts.
* **Lazy Loading**: Episode card thumbnails use `loading="lazy"` to defer off‑screen image loading and improve initial rendering.
* **Bundle Analysis Scripts**: `package.json` exposes `analyze` and `build:analyze` scripts that run `vite-bundle-visualizer` for inspecting bundle size and composition.
* **Code Splitting**: The `rollupOptions.manualChunks` function groups vendor dependencies (`react`, `framer-motion`, `lucide-react`, etc.) and splits episode code by season, ensuring that only needed code is loaded.

## Potential Areas for Improvement

* **Enhanced Caching**: Leverage long‑term HTTP caching headers for static assets and expand the service worker's runtime caching strategy beyond Google Fonts.
* **Preload & Prefetch**: Use `<link rel="preload">` or `<link rel="prefetch">` hints for critical scripts and assets, especially the next episode's data or heavy components.
* **Service Worker Features**: Explore offline support for episodes and asset caching using Workbox strategies. Precache key routes and enable background sync for better resilience.
* **Dynamic Imports**: Introduce `React.lazy` and dynamic `import()` calls for pages or heavy components so they are loaded only when needed.
