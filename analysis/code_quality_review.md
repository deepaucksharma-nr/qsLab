# Code Quality Review: TechFlix

This document provides a brief assessment of the code quality within the TechFlix repository based on the available files and tooling configuration.

## TypeScript and Static Analysis

- The project includes a `tsconfig.json` and uses TypeScript across the codebase. Static typing improves reliability and developer productivity.
- ESLint is configured with `@typescript-eslint` rules, catching common issues during development.
- Prettier enforces consistent formatting; Husky hooks ensure linting and formatting run before commits.

## Testing

- Unit and component tests are implemented using Vitest and React Testing Library. Test setup is located in `src/test/setup.js`, and example tests exist for components like `Header` and `LoadingScreen`.
- Test coverage can be generated via the `test:coverage` npm script. Increasing coverage, especially around interactive episode logic, will further improve confidence in future changes.

## Code Organization

- Components and state management are well organized. Scene components are separated from generic UI components, and tests are colocated with their respective modules.
- Import aliases defined in `vite.config.js` reduce relative path complexity.

## Maintainability

- The use of custom hooks (`useAudio`, `usePerformanceMonitor`, `useVoiceOver`, etc.) encapsulates complex logic, promoting reuse and readability.
- Logging utilities and performance monitoring hooks demonstrate attention to observability and debuggability.
- Some files under `docs/archives` may no longer reflect the current codebase; cleaning these up would streamline onboarding for new contributors.

## Summary

Overall, TechFlix follows modern best practices for React projects. Static typing, linting, formatting, and testing are all present. Maintaining high test coverage and periodically reviewing documentation and archived files will help sustain code quality as the project grows.
