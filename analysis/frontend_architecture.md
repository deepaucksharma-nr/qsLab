# Frontend Architecture Analysis: TechFlix

## Core Framework and Build Tools

*   **React 18**: The project uses React 18 as its core JavaScript library for building the user interface.
*   **Vite 5.4**: Vite is employed as the build tool and development server, known for its speed and efficient Hot Module Replacement (HMR).
*   **TypeScript**: The presence of `tsconfig.json` and `@typescript-eslint/parser` in `package.json` indicates the use of TypeScript for static typing, enhancing code quality and maintainability.

## Component Structure

*   The project follows a component-based architecture, evident from the `src/components/` directory.
*   Specialized component directories like `src/components/scenes/` suggest a structured approach to building complex UI elements for episodes.
*   Reusable UI components are likely present for common elements like headers, episode cards, etc.

## State Management

*   The `README.md` mentions "Custom stores with React hooks."
*   The `package.json` lists `zustand` as a dependency, a popular lightweight state management library for React. It's possible both are used, or Zustand is the primary "custom store" implementation.
*   `src/store/episodeStore.js` further confirms the use of a dedicated store, likely for managing episode-related state.

## Routing

*   `react-router-dom` is listed as a dependency, indicating its use for client-side routing.
*   The `src/router/` directory likely contains the route configurations for different pages like `HomePage`, `BrowsePage`, `EpisodePage`, etc., found in `src/pages/`.

## Styling

*   **Tailwind CSS**: The project utilizes Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework, for styling. This is confirmed by `tailwind.config.js` and `postcss.config.js`.
*   **Custom Design System**: The `README.md` also mentions a "Custom Design System," suggesting that alongside Tailwind, there might be a set of predefined components, styles, or design tokens to maintain consistency. Files like `techflix-design-system.css` support this.
*   **Framer Motion**: Used for animations, as per the `README.md` and `framer-motion` dependency.
*   CSS files are located in `src/styles/`.

## Overall Impression

The frontend architecture appears modern and well-structured, leveraging popular and efficient tools. The combination of React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, and a dedicated state management solution provides a solid foundation for a complex interactive application like TechFlix.
