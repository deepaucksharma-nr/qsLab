# Documentation and Tooling Analysis: TechFlix

## Documentation

The project features an extensive `docs/` directory, indicating a strong emphasis on documentation.

*   **Types of Documentation**:
    *   **Guides**: `docs/guides/` contains practical guides for development, episode creation, components, debugging, sound effects, and voiceovers.
    *   **Reference**: `docs/reference/api.md` suggests API documentation.
    *   **READMEs**: Multiple `README.md` files exist, including a comprehensive one in the `techflix/` root and another in `techflix/docs/`.
    *   **Changelog and Progress Tracking**: Files like `CHANGELOG.md` and various progress update markdown files (e.g., `CINEMATIC_DESIGN_UPDATE_PROGRESS.md`) show a commitment to tracking changes and development.
    *   **Archived Documents**: `docs/archives/` contains a wealth of historical documents, which could be useful for understanding project evolution but might also indicate a need for pruning or summarizing outdated information.

*   **Quality**: The presence of detailed guides for specific tasks (like episode creation) is a positive sign for developer onboarding and maintainability.

## Development Tooling

*   **Build System**: Vite 5.4 (`vite.config.js`, `package.json` scripts) for fast development and optimized builds.
*   **Package Manager**: npm (inferred from `package-lock.json` and npm scripts).
*   **Version Control**: Git (inferred from `.gitignore`, `.github/`).
*   **Linters and Formatters**:
    *   ESLint (`.eslintrc.json`) for JavaScript/JSX and TypeScript linting.
    *   Prettier (`.prettierrc.json`) for code formatting.
    *   These are enforced via Husky pre-commit hooks (`.husky/pre-commit`, `lint-staged` in `package.json`), ensuring code consistency.
*   **Type Checking**: TypeScript (`tsconfig.json`, `type-check` script).
*   **Testing**:
    *   Vitest (`vitest.config.js`) as the test runner.
    *   React Testing Library (dev dependency) for component testing.
    *   `happy-dom` for providing a DOM environment for tests.
    *   Test coverage script (`test:coverage`).
    *   UI mode for Vitest (`test:ui`).
*   **CI/CD**:
    *   GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) for continuous integration.
*   **Bundle Analysis**:
    *   `vite-bundle-visualizer` (`analyze` script) and `rollup-plugin-visualizer` for inspecting bundle sizes.
*   **Custom Scripts**:
    *   Various scripts in `scripts/` for tasks like generating voiceovers and sound effects.
*   **Debug Tools**:
    *   A built-in Debug Panel (`src/components/DebugPanel.jsx`).
    *   Performance monitoring hook (`src/hooks/usePerformanceMonitor.js`).
