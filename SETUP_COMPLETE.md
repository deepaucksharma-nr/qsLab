## Your Next Steps

### 1. Start Immediately (15 minutes)
```bash
cd labs/week1-xray
docker-compose up -d
./scripts/generate-traffic.sh
# Follow exercise-01-metric-xray.md
```

### 2. Understand the Foundation
- Read `docs/00-foundation/mental-models.md` to connect Kafka to what you know
- Review `docs/00-foundation/core-concepts.md` for Kafka-specific concepts

### 3. Track Your Progress
- Update `PROGRESS.md` as you complete exercises
- Add your insights and questions
- Document your discoveries

## Remember Your Goal

**Transform from a "map-reader" to a "map-maker" in Kafka observability**

You're not just learning to use tools - you're learning to:
- Extend them
- Debug them
- Optimize them
- Build new ones

## Support

- **Questions?** Add them to your learning log
- **Stuck?** Each exercise has analysis questions to guide you
- **Ideas?** This is YOUR repository - customize it!

Ready to begin your transformation? Start with the quick start guide:
```bash
cat QUICK_START.md
