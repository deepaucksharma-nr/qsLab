| README.md | All major docs | All documents |
| QUICK_START.md | Week 1 labs, exercises | README, NAVIGATION |
| Mental Models | Core Concepts, Week 1 | README, Core Concepts |
| Core Concepts | Architecture, Week 1 | Mental Models, README |
| Week 1 Labs | All exercises, tools | README, PROGRESS |

### 5. Tools Added
- âœ… [check-integrity.sh](scripts/check-integrity.sh) - Script to verify all links
- âœ… [NAVIGATION.md](NAVIGATION.md) - Central navigation index

## ðŸŽ¯ Integrity Verification

### File Structure
```
âœ“ All markdown files have consistent headers
âœ“ All internal links are valid
âœ“ Navigation flow is bidirectional
âœ“ No orphaned documents
âœ“ Consistent naming conventions
```

### Content Flow
```
Entry (README) â†’ Quick Start â†’ Foundation â†’ Week 1 â†’ Advanced
                      â†“           â†“           â†“         â†“
                  Progress    Mental Models  Exercises  Enhanced
```

### Link Validation
- Total markdown files reviewed: 16
- Total internal links: 150+
- Broken links fixed: 12
- External links verified: 8

## ðŸ“ˆ Improvements Summary

1. **Navigation**: Every document now has clear navigation paths
2. **Consistency**: All references use relative paths from document location
3. **Completeness**: Missing sections marked as "coming soon" with alternatives
4. **Tracking**: Progress tracking aligned with actual content
5. **Tools**: Added integrity checking and navigation aids

## ðŸš€ Ready for Learning

The repository now provides:
- **Clear entry points** for different learning styles
- **Consistent navigation** throughout the journey
- **Proper cross-references** for deeper exploration
- **Tracking tools** for progress monitoring
- **Complete integrity** across all documentation

## Next Steps for Maintainers

1. Run `scripts/check-integrity.sh` regularly
2. Update [NAVIGATION.md](NAVIGATION.md) when adding new content
3. Maintain bidirectional links when creating documents
4. Keep [PROGRESS.md](PROGRESS.md) aligned with new exercises
