## Summary

This is a **major refactor** that:
1. ✅ Modernizes the build system (Parcel → Vite)
2. ✅ Expands content (2 → 8+ episodes)  
3. ✅ Improves architecture (routing, state, components)
4. ✅ Enhances developer experience (debugging, testing)
5. ✅ Adds production features (PWA, optimization)
6. ✅ Reorganizes documentation
7. ⚠️ Has some incomplete episodes needing configuration

The changes represent a significant upgrade to make TechFlix a production-ready, scalable platform with modern tooling and architecture.
