# Critical Fixes Applied

## Summary of Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Episode Import Errors
**Problem**: Episodes 6 & 7 were imported but didn't exist
**Fix**: Commented out missing imports in `src/episodes/index.js`

### 2. ✅ Missing Hook Error  
**Problem**: `useEpisodeProgress` hook was missing
**Fix**: Created `src/hooks/useEpisodeProgress.js` with full implementation

### 3. ✅ Router Integration
**Problem**: App.jsx logic was orphaned by new router
**Fix**: BrowsePage now contains all App.jsx logic (without duplicate header)

### 4. ✅ Production Server
**Problem**: No way to serve production build
**Fix**: Added Express server in `server.js`

### 5. ✅ Component Import Issues
**Problem**: NetflixEpisodePlayer importing from wrong location
**Fix**: Updated to import from hooks directory

## Remaining Issues to Address

### 1. Episode Routes Missing
The router doesn't include episode watch routes. Need to add:
```javascript
{
  path: 'watch/:seriesId/:seasonId/:episodeId',
  element: <EpisodePage />
}
```

### 2. Unused Pages
Created pages (EpisodePage, SearchPage) are not in router

### 3. State Management Confusion
- App uses React Context
- New pages expect Zustand
- Need to pick one approach

### 4. Missing Episode Implementations
Episodes 6 & 7 directories exist but have no content

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies (includes new ones)
npm install

# Start development
npm run dev

# Build and serve production
npm run start
```

## Testing the Fixes

1. **Check app starts**: `npm run dev`
2. **Verify episodes load**: Should see all episodes
3. **Test episode playback**: Click any episode
4. **Check progress tracking**: Progress should save

## Next Steps

1. Add missing routes to router
2. Implement missing episodes or remove directories
3. Choose single state management approach
4. Add tests for critical paths
