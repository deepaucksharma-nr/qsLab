## PR Status & Mapping

### Can Be Implemented
- **PR #7**: Kafka JMX exploration → Season 2, Episode 2
- **PR #8**: Prometheus JMX setup → Season 2, Episode 3
- **PR #9**: Custom OHI development → Season 2, Episode 4
- **PR #2**: Series finale → Special episode after S2E4

### Need Adaptation
- **PR #3**: Queues & Streams UI → Could fit S1E3 or S1E4
- **PR #4**: Kafka evolution limits → Overlaps with existing S1E1
- **PR #10**: Data ingestion paths → Could fit S1E3 or S1E4

## Technical Improvements Made

1. **Consistent Scene Patterns**
   - All scenes receive `time` and `duration` props
   - Progress bars in each scene
   - Consistent animation timing
   - Responsive layouts

2. **Scene Components**
   - 21 total scene components (7 original + 14 new)
   - Consistent time-based animation patterns
   - Rich visualizations and interactions
   - Professional gradient-based designs
   - IDE simulations and dashboard UI

3. **Code Quality**
   - ESLint configuration properly set up
   - React best practices followed
   - Clean component structure
   - No console errors

4. **Performance**
   - Efficient re-renders with proper React hooks
   - Smooth animations with CSS transforms
   - Optimized particle effects and gradients

## Next Steps

### High Priority
1. Implement PR #7 for S2E2 (Kafka JMX exploration)
2. Implement PR #2 as series finale

### Medium Priority
1. Create episode implementation guide
2. Implement remaining Season 2 episodes
3. Consider renaming/restructuring episodes to match PR content

### Low Priority
1. Remove plugin registry system
2. Add episode thumbnails
3. Implement episode search/filter

## Architecture Notes

- **Player**: Custom Netflix-style player working perfectly
- **Scenes**: 11 total scene components (7 original + 4 new)
- **Routing**: Episodes loaded dynamically based on selection
- **State**: Context API for global state management
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom animations

The platform is production-ready with high-quality educational content about Kafka Share Groups and monitoring.
