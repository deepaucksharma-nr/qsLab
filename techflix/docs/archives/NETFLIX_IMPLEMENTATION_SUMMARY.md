## 🚀 How to Use

The Netflix-style episode section is now active in your app. To see it:

1. Start the dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to http://localhost:1234
3. Play any episode to see progress tracking in action
4. Refresh the page - progress persists!

## 🎨 Visual Improvements

- **Grid View**: Netflix-style card layout with 16:9 aspect ratio
- **List View**: Detailed episode information with inline progress
- **Gradient Fallbacks**: Color-coded by season when thumbnails are missing
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts from 1 to 4 columns based on screen size

## 📊 Progress Tracking Details

Progress is stored in localStorage with keys like:
- `progress_s1e1` - Season 1, Episode 1
- `progress_s2e3` - Season 2, Episode 3

Each progress object contains:
```javascript
{
  watched: boolean,
  watchedDate: string (ISO date),
  timeWatched: number (seconds),
  percentComplete: number (0-100),
  lastWatchedPosition: number (seconds),
  lastWatchedDate: string (ISO date)
}
```

   - Skip to next episode functionality
   - Episode selector dropdown

2. **Auto-play Next Episode** (Low Priority)

   - Skip credits button
   - User preference settings

3. **Enhanced Mobile Experience** (Low Priority)
   - Touch gestures
   - Portrait mode optimizations
   - Swipe navigation

## 🖼️ Adding Real Assets

To add thumbnails and preview videos:

1. Create the following directory structure:
```
public/
├── images/
│   └── episodes/
│       ├── s1e1-thumbnail.jpg
│       ├── s1e2-thumbnail.jpg
│       └── ...
└── videos/
    └── episodes/
        ├── s1e1-preview.mp4
        └── ...
```

2. Update episode data with actual URLs in `EnhancedEpisodesSectionFixed.jsx`:
```javascript
thumbnail: "/images/episodes/s1e1-thumbnail.jpg",
previewVideo: "/videos/episodes/s1e1-preview.mp4",
```

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **Preview Videos**: Currently referenced but not implemented (no actual video files)
2. **Thumbnails**: Using gradient placeholders instead of real images
3. **Ratings**: Using mock data (random scores)
4. **Download Feature**: Button present but not functional

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. Generate episode thumbnails from key scenes
2. Create 10-30 second preview clips for hover functionality
3. Implement episode-to-episode navigation
4. Add user preferences for auto-play
5. Create a backend API for cross-device progress sync
