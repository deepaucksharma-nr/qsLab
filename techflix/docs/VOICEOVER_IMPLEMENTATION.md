# Voice-Over Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented Microsoft Edge TTS (Text-to-Speech) voice-over system for TechFlix episodes. The system generates and serves audio narration as static assets for the development environment.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Voice-Over Generation Script
- **File**: `scripts/generate-voiceovers.js`
- **Features**:
  - Uses `edge-tts` for high-quality voice synthesis
  - Supports 4 voice types: narrator, technical, dramatic, alternate
  - Generates MP3 files with metadata (JSON)
  - Progress tracking during generation

### 2. React Integration
- **Hook**: `src/hooks/useVoiceOver.js`
  - Manages audio playback state
  - Syncs with episode timing
  - Handles loading, playing, pausing
  - Tracks playback progress

- **Component**: `src/components/VoiceOverControls.jsx`
  - UI controls for voice-over playback
  - Minimal and full control modes
  - Volume control and progress bar

- **Player Integration**: `src/components/NetflixEpisodePlayer.jsx`
  - Integrated voice-over controls
  - Auto-plays voice for each scene
  - Syncs with scene transitions

### 3. Generated Voice-Overs

| Episode | Scenes | Total Duration | Files |
|---------|--------|----------------|-------|
| S1E1 | 4 | 64 seconds | problem-viz, bottleneck-demo, share-group-arch, impact-metrics |
| S1E2 | 4 | 60 seconds | opening, critical-metrics, evolution, impact |
| S2E1 | 4 | 66 seconds | evolution, bottleneck, share-groups, impact |
| S3E3 | 2 | 33 seconds | recap, call-to-action |

**Total**: 14 voice-overs, 223 seconds of audio content

### 4. Voice Configuration

```javascript
const VOICES = {
  narrator: 'en-US-JennyNeural',        // Main narrator
  alternateNarrator: 'en-US-GuyNeural', // Alternative voice
  technical: 'en-US-AriaNeural',        // Technical explanations
  dramatic: 'en-US-ChristopherNeural'  // Dramatic moments
};
```

### 5. Usage

#### Generate Voice-Overs
```bash
npm run generate:voiceovers
```

#### List Available Voice-Overs
```bash
npm run voiceover:list
```

#### In Development
Voice-overs automatically play when episodes are viewed. Users can:
- Toggle voice-over on/off
- Control volume
- See playback progress
- Pause/resume narration

### 6. File Structure
```
public/
└── audio/
    └── voiceovers/
        ├── index.json          # Master index
        ├── s1e1/              # Season 1 Episode 1
        │   ├── *.mp3          # Audio files
        │   └── *.json         # Metadata

        └── s3e3/              # Season 3 Episode 3
```

## Technical Notes
- Audio files are served as static assets from `/public/audio/voiceovers/`
- Each audio file has accompanying JSON metadata with duration and voice info
- Voice-over playback is synchronized with scene timing
- System supports hot-reloading during development
