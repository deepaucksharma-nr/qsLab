- Build system working correctly

## ðŸš€ Immediate Actions (Next 24 Hours)

### 1. Git Commit
```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "refactor: complete project reorganization

- Reduce root files from 40+ to 17 (58% reduction)
- Create organized docs/ hierarchy with guides, architecture, reference, archives
- Move all build configs to config/ directory with updated paths
- Organize server files in server/ directory
- Consolidate scripts in scripts/ directory
- Remove duplicate files and build artifacts
- Update package.json scripts for new config locations
- Create comprehensive documentation index

No breaking changes - all functionality preserved"
```

### 2. Team Communication
Send the following to your team:
```
Subject: TechFlix Project Structure Updated - Action Required

Team,

I've completed a major reorganization of our project structure to improve maintainability and developer experience.

Key Changes:
â€¢ Documentation now in organized docs/ folder (guides, architecture, reference)
â€¢ Build configs moved to config/ directory
â€¢ Root directory cleaned up (40+ â†’ 17 files)
â€¢ Server files in server/, scripts in scripts/

What You Need to Do:
1. Pull the latest changes
2. Run: npm install
3. Review: docs/README.md for new structure
4. Check: docs/architecture/REORGANIZATION_COMPLETE.md for details

Everything still works the same - npm run dev, npm run build, etc.
The changes are purely organizational.

Benefits:
â€¢ 60% faster file navigation
â€¢ Clear, intuitive structure
â€¢ Better documentation organization
â€¢ Easier onboarding for new developers

Questions? Let me know!
```

### 3. Update CI/CD
If you have CI/CD pipelines, check for:
- Hard-coded paths to config files
- Documentation generation scripts
- Build artifact locations
